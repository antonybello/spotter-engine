# Spotter Engine

Spotter Engine is my first crack at making a NodeJS/Express backend, made for my NativeScript [Spotter App](http://www.github.com/antonybello/spotter). It listens for requests made by Spotter and uses Node's 'async' and 'request' modules to make parallel queries to VIMOC Technologies' Landscape Computing API. The client sends the name of the button clicked as a header to the server, which then builds query strings for the API call to VIMOC. The response sent back is a sorted array of JSON objects each containing the parking area and its vacancy percentage from an hour ago to the current time. The catch is, I'm not sure how frequently the sensors get updated, so the data may not be accurate. But VIMOC provides a real-time query on whether or not a specific parking spot is occupied, so I could possibly add that as an extension to the Spotter application, along with the others listed on the Spotter page.
